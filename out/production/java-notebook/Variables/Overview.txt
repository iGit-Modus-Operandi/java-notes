The Primitive/Simple Types
    Java defines eight primitive types of data: byte, short, int, long, char, float, double, and boolean.

• Integers - This group includes byte, short, int, and long, which are for whole-valued signed numbers.
    long: 64 bits (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807) - useful when big, whole numbers are needed
    int: 32 bits (–2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647) - most commonly used integer type
    short: 16 bits (–32,768 to 32,767) - probably the least used Java type
    byte: 8 bits or 1 byte (–128 to 127) - especially useful when you’re working with a stream of data from a network or file.
        They are also useful when you’re working with raw binary data that may not be directly compatible with Java’s other built-in types

• Floating-point numbers - This group includes float and double, which represent numbers with fractional precision.
    float: 32 bits (~1.4e–045 to 3.4e+038) - specifies a single-precision value that uses 32 bits of storage.
        Single precision is faster on some processors and takes half as much space as double precision,
        but will become imprecise when the values are either very large or very small.
        Variables of type float are useful when you need a fractional component, but don’t require a large degree of precision
    double: 64 bits (~4.9e–324 to 1.8e+308) - When you need to maintain accuracy over many iterative calculations, or are manipulating large-valued numbers,
        double is the best choice. Double precision is actually faster than single precision on some modern processors that have been optimized
        for high-speed mathematical calculations.

• Characters - This group includes char, which represents symbols in a character set, like letters and numbers.
    char: 16 bits (0 to 65,535) - Java uses Unicode to represent characters. Unicode defines a fully international character set
        that can represent all of the characters found in all human languages. It is a unification of dozens of character sets,
        such as Latin, Greek, Arabic, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Katakana, Hangul, and many more.

• Boolean - This group includes boolean, which is a special type for representing true/false values.
    boolean - It can have only one of two possible values, true or false. This is the type returned by all relational operators.

type identifier [ = value ][, identifier [= value ] …]; //TODO: revise, too confusing
    type is one of Java’s atomic types or the name of a class or interface
    identifier is the name of the variable
