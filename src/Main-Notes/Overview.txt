HISTORY
  Java was developed by James Gosling, Patrick Naughton, Chris Warth, Ed Frank, and Mike Sheridan in 1991 in Sun MicroSystems which was later acquired by Oracle.
  It was originally called Oak after a real oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later it was renamed to green and finally into Java, inspired by the coffee.

PILLARS OF OOP
Abstraction
Encapsulation - a protective wrapper that prevents the code and data from being arbitrarily accessed by other code defined outside the wrapper.
  Access to the code and data inside the wrapper is tightly controlled through a well-defined interface.
Inheritance - is the process by which one object acquires the properties of another object
