CLASS
- is at the core of Java
- it is the logical construct upon which the entire Java language is built
- it defines the shape and nature of an object
- forms the basis for object-oriented programming in Java
- any concept you wish to implement in a Java program must be encapsulated within a class

General Form:
- When you define a class, you declare its exact form and nature. You do this by specifying the data that it contains and the code that operates on that data.
- declared by use of the class keyword
- the data or variables defined within a class are called instance variables
- the code is contained within methods
- collectively, the methods and variables defined within a class are called members of the class
- In most classes, the instance variables are acted upon and accessed by the methods defined for that class.
  Thus, as a general rule, it is the methods that determine how a classâ€™ data can be used.

Format:
class classname {
  type instance-variable1;
  type instance-variable2;
  // ...
  type instance-variableN;

  type methodname1(parameter-list) {
  // body of method
  }

  type methodname2(parameter-list) {
  // body of method
  }

  // ...
  type methodnameN(parameter-list) {
  // body of method
  }
}
