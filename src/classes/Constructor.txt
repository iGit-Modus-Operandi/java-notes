CONSTRUCTOR
- initializes an object immediately upon creation
- has the same name as the class in which it resides and is syntactically similar to a method
- once defined, the constructor is automatically called when the object is created, before the new operator completes
- they have no return type, not even void because the implicit return type of a class’ constructor is the class type itself
- it is the constructor’s job to initialize the internal state of an object so that the code creating an instance will have a fully initialized, usable object immediately
