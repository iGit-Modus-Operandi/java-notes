HISTORY
  - Java was developed by James Gosling, Patrick Naughton, Chris Warth, Ed Frank, and Mike Sheridan in 1991 in Sun MicroSystems which was later acquired by Oracle.
  - It was originally called Oak after a real oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later it was renamed to green and finally into Java, inspired by the coffee.

PILLARS OF OOP
* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
    - A protective wrapper that prevents the code and data from being arbitrarily accessed by other code defined outside the wrapper.
    - Access to the code and data inside the wrapper is tightly controlled through a well-defined interface.
* Inheritance
    - is the process by which one object acquires the properties of another object.
* Polymorphism
    - from Greek, meaning “many forms”, is a feature that allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions.
      * Overriding: overwriting the method of a parent class with another implementation from the child class
      * Overloading: changing the behavior of a particular model depending on the parameter used during the invocation of that method

ATOMIC ELEMENTS
* whitespace
    - includes space, tab, newline, or form feed
* identifiers
    - used to name things such as classes, variables, and methods
    - may be any descriptive sequence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, or the underscore (beginning JDK 9, cannot be used by itself) and dollar-sign (not intended for general use)
    - must not begin with a number (they may be confused with a numeric literal)
    - case-sensitive
      * Naming Conventions
        - PascalNamingConvention -> Classes
        - camelCaseNamingConvention -> Methods
* literals
    - representation of constant value in Java
    - can be used anywhere a value of its type is allowed
* comments
    * single-line
    * multiline
    * documentation comment
      - used to produce an HTML file that documents your program
      - begins with a /** and ends with a */
* separators
* operators
* keywords
    - there are 67 keywords currently defined in the Java language
