INHERITANCE
- one of the cornerstones of object-oriented programming because it allows the creation of hierarchical classifications
- you can create a general class that defines traits common to a set of related items

superclass - a class that is inherited
subclass - the class that does the inheriting

Format:
class subclass-name extends superclass-name {
  // body of class
}
